Oh say can you see by the dawns early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight
Oer the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
Oh say does that starspangled banner yet wave
Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave

On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep
Where the foes haughty host in dread silence reposes
What is that which the breeze oer the towering steep
As it fitfully blows half conceals half discloses
Now it catches the gleam of the mornings first beam
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream
Tis the starspangled banner Oh long may it wave
Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battles confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps pollution
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave
And the starspangled banner in triumph doth wave
Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave

Oh thus be it ever when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the wars desolation
Blest with victory and peace may the heavn rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation
Then conquer we must when our cause it is just
And this be our motto In God is our trust
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave
